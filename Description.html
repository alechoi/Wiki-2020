            <h1>The Problem</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                For a number of decades, the agricultural industry has sought to enact the 
                benefits of genetically modified (GM) crops to improve crop yields and mitigate
                crop losses due to pests and pathogens. GM crops can decrease pesticide usage in 
                large-scale agricultural production[1] and uptake nutrients more efficiently than 
                their unmodified counterparts[2]. 
                <br><br>
                While genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have 
                revolutionized the current worldview of agriculture, farmers and scientists alike 
                have raised concerns over their negative effects on the environment. 
                Particularly, gene flow—the transfer of genetic variation from one population to 
                another—from cultivated crops to weedy or wild crops is a potential risk of 
                commercializing GM crops. 
                <br><br>
                Gene flow can decrease genetic variation within a 
                population by modifying allele frequencies[3]. 
                If the rate of gene flow is high enough, GM crops can outcompete their 
                wild-type (WT) counterparts, leading to decreased biodiversity. 
            </p>

            <br><br>
            <h1>Biodiversity's Importance</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                “Agricultural biodiversity,” or agrobiodiversity, consists of animals, plants, 
                and microorganisms at the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels are necessary 
                to sustain key functions in the agro-system[4]. Generally, greater biodiversity 
                enables agricultural productivity over a wider range of conditions[5]. 
                In light of climate change, maintaining agrobiodiversity is necessary to ensure 
                the resilience of food crop production. 
                <br><br>
                The 1800s Irish potato famine highlights the importance of agrobiodiversity[6]. 
                The lack of genetic variability in the potatoes proved detrimental when the 
                pathogen, P. infestans, wiped out the entire population. This lack of genetic 
                variability is seen today; 7,000 plant species are used for human consumption, 
                yet four crops provide half of the global plant-based energy intake and 15 crops 
                contribute another two-thirds[5].
                <br><br>
                As the popularity of GMOs increases, concerns that they could reduce the 
                biodiversity of the agricultural landscape and surrounding ecosystems also 
                increase. The effectiveness of herbicide-resistant crops have eliminated 
                milkweeds from many fields. However, the loss of milkweed harms insects like the 
                monarch butterfly, which has experienced a population decline of about 80% in the 
                last two decades[7]. Therefore, our project seeks an innovative solution to the 
                consequences of GM crops while still reaping their benefits.
            </p>

            <br><br>
            <h1>Indoor Farming - An Incomplete Solution</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                There are many prospective solutions to combat gene flow and its impact on 
                agriculture. One is vertical farming, which involves cultivating produce in 
                vertically arranged layers. It has paved the way for sustainable agricultural 
                practices, allowing farmers and agricultural industries greater control over 
                factors like soil and water use, and gas emission levels[8].
                <br><br>
                With hydroponic farming methods, farmers can introduce oxygen and other nutrients 
                to plant roots, allowing for more growth cycles in less time. Traditional farming 
                methods rely on nitrogen-containing fertilizers, which increase the amount of 
                atmospheric nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Growing produce in an indoor 
                environment gives farmers more control over their crops and prevents intervention 
                from animals, pathogens, and even other plants—reducing gene flow. 
                <br><br>
                Indoor vertical farming is an effective strategy for promoting conservation and 
                minimizing gene flow that could occur in conventional farming methods. 
                However, this strategy lacks control at the level of an individual organism 
                if it were to be inadvertently introduced to the environment.
            </p>

            <br><br>
            <h1>Hypersensitive Response</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Programmed cell death (PCD) is a common process that occurs in many organisms 
                during development in response to environmental or biotic stimuli. One of the 
                best characterized forms of PCD in animals is called apoptosis. However, plant 
                cell death is not characterized as apoptosis, because plant cell death 
                mechanisms lack some of its hallmarks. Namely, lack of caspase proteins, 
                a major player in a cell’s commitment to apoptosis, and the inability to 
                participate in phagocytosis due to a rigid cell wall is why controlled 
                processes of plant cell death are referred to as PCD rather than apoptosis[9].
                <br><br>
                Instead, plants participate in a different pathway of programmed cell death 
                known as the hypersensitive response (HR). It should be noted that, much like 
                apoptotic mechanisms are not identical across all animals, HR in plants is also 
                not exact across the board. Though it is not nearly as well characterized, the 
                hallmarks of HR are strikingly similar to those found in animal apoptosis. 
                Comparable features include cytoplasmic shrinkage, cytochrome c release, 
                mitochondrial swelling, chromatin condensation, and loss of mitochondrial 
                membrane potential. Additionally, plant cells undergo formation of large 
                vesicles, disruption of the cytoskeleton and the cessation of cytoplasmic 
                streaming during HR[10].
            </p>

            <br><br>
            <h1>Bax and the Hypersensitive Response</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Bax is a member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Among other processes, these 
                proteins regulate pathways associated with apoptosis. Bcl-2 proteins can 
                either be pro-apoptotic and work to induce apoptosis (like Bax/Bak), or 
                anti-apoptotic and work to inhibit apoptosis (like Bcl-2 proteins).
                Bax is crucial for the assembly of a structure called the mitochondrial 
                apoptosis-induced channel (MAC)[13]. This structure is a channel in the 
                outer membrane of the mitochondria (OMM) that releases proteins that reside 
                in the intermembrane space. In response to apoptotic-inducing insults, Bax, 
                the pro-apoptotic protein, translocates from the cytosol to the OMM. 
                <br><br>
                Once associated with the OMM, Bax oligomerizes and forms the mitochondrial 
                apoptosis-induced channel (MAC). This protein interacts with and increases 
                the opening of the mitochondrial voltage-gated anion channel (VDAC), which 
                leads to loss in membrane potential. This subsequently releases cytochrome c, 
                which triggers the permeabilization of OMM via the release of Smac1, 
                and ultimately the activation of a caspase cascade, a key event in committing 
                the cell to undergoing apoptosis through intrinsic pathways in animal cells[14].
                <br><br> 
                Although not endogenous to plants, Bax can be expressed (crucially, overexpressed) 
                in plant tissues, ultimately resulting in HR-like cell death. It has been 
                suggested that this is due to the integration of Bax into the mitochondrial 
                membrane, however, Bax expression associated with HR is not well characterized 
                in plants.
