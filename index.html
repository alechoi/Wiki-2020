                        <p>
                             For a number of decades, the agricultural industry has sought to enact the benefits of genetically modified (GM) 
                        crops to improve crop yields and mitigate crop losses due to pests and pathogens. GM crops can decrease pesticide 
                        usage in large-scale agricultural production and uptake nutrients more efficiently than their unmodified 
                        counterparts. While genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have revolutionized the current worldview of 
                        agriculture, farmers and scientists alike have raised concerns over their negative effects on the environment. 
                        Particularly, gene flow—the transfer of genetic variation from one population to another—from cultivated crops 
                        to weedy or wild crops is a potential risk of commercializing GM crops. Gene flow can decrease genetic variation 
                        within a population by modifying allele frequencies. If the rate of gene flow is high enough, GM crops can 
                        outcompete their wild-type (WT) counterparts, leading to decreased biodiversity.

                                <h3> The Solution </h3>
                                </br>
                        <p>
                             There are many prospective solutions to combat gene flow and its impact on agriculture. One is vertical farming,
                        which involves cultivating produce in vertically arranged layers. It has paved the way for sustainable agricultural 
                        practices, allowing farmers and agricultural industries greater control over factors like soil and water use, and 
                        gas emission levels. With hydroponic farming methods, farmers can introduce oxygen and other nutrients to plant 
                        roots, allowing for more growth cycles in less time. Traditional farming methods rely on nitrogen-containing 
                        ertilizers, which increase the amount of atmospheric nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Growing produce in 
                        an indoor environment gives farmers more control over their crops and prevents intervention from animals, 
                        pathogens, and even other plants—reducing gene flow. Indoor vertical farming is an effective strategy for 
                        promoting conservation and minimizing gene flow that could occur in conventional farming methods. However, 
                        this strategy lacks control at the level of an individual organism if it were to be inadvertently introduced 
                        to the environment.
                             Using an optogenetic approach, plants could grow under red and blue light, but die when exposed to natural 
                        light. With the indoor farming industry projected to reach upwards of 22 billion USD by 2026, controlling 
                        plant growth would become advantageous. Indoor farmers would be at greater liberty to modify their crops 
                        without worrying about the deleterious effects of gene flow.
