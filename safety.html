            <p>
                In the modern era, responsible and safe research is a top priority, for both
                the subjects it applies to, and the scientists that carry it out. All researchers at
                Stony Brook University must complete an array of assesments and modules demonstrating knowledge of
                lab safety procedures, waste disposal and procedures that must take place in the event of an accident.
                Our lab at the Center for Molecular Medicine has a Biosafety level 1 rating, meaning it requires us students to
                utilize the following safety protocols:
                 </p>
                 </br>
            <ul>
                <li style = "margin-left: 50px"> Decontamination of all materials prior to disposal via autoclave; </li>
                </br>
                <li style = "margin-left: 50px"> Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as nitrile gloves, ANSI Z87.1 safety goggles
                and long lab coats; </li>
                </br>
                <li style = "margin-left: 50px"> Prohibition of all food, drinks and smoking materials inside of and around the lab. </li>
            </ul>

            </h2>
            <p>
                In preparation for wetlab work, all members of the Stony Brook iGEM team must complete a
                 <a href = "https://about.citiprogram.org/en/series/responsible-conduct-of-research-rcr/">Collaborative institutional Training initiative (CITI) 
                 </a>
                on responsible conduct of research. Stony Brook safety courses are required as well to teach students waste disposal and different hazards.
                These courses include dealing with hazardous wastes (ENV 001), chemical hazards (ELS 002), biological hazards (ELS 003), and regulated medical
                waste (ENV 005). More information on these courses can be found <a href = "https://ehs.stonybrook.edu//services/training/training-course-list-and-descriptions#LabSafety"> here </a>.

                Safety and Ethical Concerns
            </h2>
            <p>
                Our experiemnts are closely tied to Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). Therefore,
                there are some ethical concerns that must be addressed. Preservation of native species
                is a primary goal of our work, focusing on limiting gene flow if/when GMO organisms escape 
                greenhouses into the natural environment...(tbc as we continue the project)
